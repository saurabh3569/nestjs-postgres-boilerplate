# NestJS Postgres Boilerplate

This repository is a **work in progress** NestJS-Postgres boilerplate, designed to provide a solid foundation for setting up any NestJS application with PostgreSQL. It includes basic configuration and setup for working with:

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building scalable server-side applications.
- **TypeORM**: An ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for managing PostgreSQL databases.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.

## Features

- Simple and easy-to-use configuration for PostgreSQL using environment variables.
- Pre-configured **TypeORM** for database operations.
- A basic **Task** and **User** module setup for managing entities.
- Environment-based configuration using `.env` files.
- Synchronization and logging of database schema changes for ease of development.

## Planned Enhancements

This boilerplate is **actively being developed** and will soon include the following features:

- **Migrations**: Implement best practices for database migrations using TypeORM to handle schema changes and version control.
- **Environment Configuration**: Robust and scalable environment configuration, allowing easy switching between development, staging, and production environments.
- **Docker Support**: Add Docker configuration for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **Best Practices**: Follow best practices for structuring the project, database management, and application configuration.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Integrate JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization.
- **Additional Modules**: Expand the project with additional modules and services commonly needed in REST APIs.
- **Testing**: Include unit and integration tests to ensure application reliability.
